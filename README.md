# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this challenge is to be able to pull earthquake data and plot it on the map. The map shows the magnitude of the earthquakes through different colors. 

With the map users are able to choose between street mode, satellite mode and dark mode based on their preferences. They are also able to chose what layers they would like to see: All Earthquakes, tectonic plates and major earthquakes. 

The map also allows users to zoom in and out and move the map around to get a better view of each location.
